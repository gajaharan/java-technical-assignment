# Notes

Please add here any notes, assumptions and design decisions that might help up understand your though process.
- Initial refactor project structure to get better understanding of the code.
- Do not modify existing test where possible.
- Added AssertJ library to make testing easier for TDD and makes test more readable.
- Added Mockito library to mock other classes that are not under test.
